Spec:
	1. Word is a string with at least 3 word symbols in it.
	2. Word symbols are: Latin letters, dash, underscore and numbers.
	3. A Word can not start with number.

Examples:
	"this" is a word ('this' has more than 3 word symbols).
	"know-how" is one word (by spec, the dash is word symbol).
	"1st" is NOT a word, because it starts with number!
	"R2-D2" is a word, because it starts with letter!
